1)
	Global Tree lock
		Simple to implement
		Crap for performance
		
		
2)
	[recursive?] node based lock
		Harder to implement, good performance
		- Lock when there's an iterator out.
			- do this how? llocks will need to know which thread they're on
			- Boost::recursive_mutex to the rescue!
		- Lock during change / refresh
